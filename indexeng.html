								<p align=justify>At Kun Koro we offer counseling oriented to dining teams of public or private schools and afterschool projects that want to approach or deepen in a respectful accompaniment towards the children, the families and the team itself.</p>
								
								<p><center><i>Kun Koro means "with heart" in Esperanto. For us it represents accompanying from the heart, from a meaningful place, from the needs of the children, the bond and the affection.</i></center></p>
								
								<p align=justify>We have been working for years in the lunchtime of the public school <a href="http://escolacongresindians.com/"target="_blank">Congrés-Indians</a>. When the school opened its doors, offering a loving and respectful accompaniment to the needs of the children in a public school environment, the need to take care of the non-lective, such as the lunchtime, was also revealed. This meant reflecting on some normalized situations in most schools such as forcing children to eat certain amounts or food, having to nap, rewarding or punishing certain behaviors, eating together in a large dining room, etc.</p>
								<p align=justify>Little by little we forged a noon project more respectful of the needs and rhythms of the children, which is constantly evolving. Our experience and learnings has allowed us to develop an observation capacity and a methodology that we think may be of interest for other projects that consider a more respectful accompaniment.</p>

								<p align=justify>We offer counseling oriented to dining teams of public or private schools and afterschool projects that want to approach or deepen in a respectful accompaniment towards the children, the families and the team itself.</p>

								<p align=justify>We work on the needs of each project and its interests, offering observation, reflections, experiences and proposals according to each educational and dining project. We accompany the projects so that they can try to cover more the needs of the children.</p>

								<p><b>We divide the content into three basic sections:</b></p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Acompañamiento.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<p>· Emotional accompaniment and attitudes of the accompanying adult</p>
								<p align=justify>We observe possible improvements and shortcomings in how we relate to the environment and the children as accompanying adults during meals and throughout the midday fringe. We offer training, reflections and experiences to work in this direction.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Logistica.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								
								<p>· Logistics at the service of the needs of children</p>
								<p align=justify>We study the logistics of the interested project and detect possible logistical changes that could have a positive impact on the children.
								Spaces, materials or proposals available, short waiting times, how many adults are in the space and how they are located, are some of the most obvious issues. However, it is also indirectly possible from the logistics to benefit the children, through achieving more well-being in the companions, families, teachers and fellow children.
								In relation to these issues we contribute our experience and elaborate proposals for improvement at a logistic level based on what we observed and the needs and demands of the interested project.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Espacios.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								
								<p>· Spaces and materials. Means for the relationship</p>
								<p align=justify>We bring our experience in terms of the layout of the spaces, their use and their materials, so that together with the logistics and the accompaniment, they create a lunchtime that is as pleasant, respectful and as rich as possible for children and adults alike.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Team</h2>
								<p align=justify>Around 2015 we began to feel, along with coworkers of the midday project of <a href="http://escolacongresindians.com/"target="_blank">Congrés-Indians</a> School, the desire to share the experience that accompaning midday in this school meant for us. We began to assess the possibility of contributing what we learned to other projects that seek a specific accompaniment for the midday project. Thus, in 2018 we, Elina and Noel started working on that and Kun Koro took shape.</p>

								<p><b>Noel Cresencio González</b></p>

								<p>Child companion. Psychomotorist. Therapist of Psycho-Corporal Integration in training</p>

								<p align = justify> I grew up in a living and active education environment at home. My mother created the project in Barcelona <a href="http://www.la-caseta.com/"target="_blank"> La Casita </a> (which was later called La Caseta) and later the living school <a href="https://www.elroure.org/"target="_blank"> El Roure </a>. My father is a teacher of tai-chi, chi-kung, martial arts, and personal growth. Both of them have been constantly training in personal growth on different lines all their lives. I attended some public schools because I was older to go to <a href="http://www.la-caseta.com/"target="_blank"> La Casita </a> and when the school was created <a href = "https://www.elroure.org/" target = "_blank"> El Roure </a>, finish primary school there before going to high school. After two courses I went to England, to the international school <a href="https://brockwood.org.uk/"target="_blank"> Brockwood Park School </a>, founded in 1969 by the philosopher and spiritual teacher Jiddu Krishnamurti. When I returned two years later I started my working life and my specific training.</p>

                <p align = justify> Following my father, I went to live to Granada, where I became independent working as a waiter, learning to carry out these tasks fully. I started my training in film, photography and acting at school <a href="https://filmosofia.com/"target="_blank"> Philosophy </a>, although I was always in contact with the world of personal growth and education, due to the personal and professional career of my parents. This influence and my own interests led me to work at the school <a href="http://escolacongresindians.com/"target="_blank"> Congrés-Indians </a> in the midday strip, since April 2011. Shortly after, I also joined the support team for teachers and I was able to deepen my work and tackle new learning.</p>
                  
                <p align = justify> I have also worked as an assistant psychomotor therapist, with Verónica Antón at <a href="https://sendabcn.com/"target="_blank"> Senda </a>, accompanying various groups of children. This experience allowed me to approach the therapeutic side of B. Aucouturier's psychomotricity and learn with Veronica. However, without a doubt my main source of experiences with boys and girls is the school <a href="http://escolacongresindians.com/"target="_blank"> Congrés-Indians </a>, through which I keep learning day by day how to accompany them to better provide them with what they need.</p>
                  
                <p align = justify> I have trained in Conscious Communication courses with <a href="https://laligera.wordpress.com/quienes-somos/"target="_blank"> Chema Irusta </a>, Emotional Accompaniment , Aggression and Conflicts at <a href="https://sendabcn.com/"target="_blank"> Path </a>, and Seitai at <a href = "https://www.espaido.com/? lang = is "target =" _ blank "> Espaidó </a>. I have also attended the annual formations of <a href="https://caiev.com"target="_blank"> Live and active education </a> with Jordi Mateu, Aucouturier Preventive Psychomotor Practice at <a href = "http : //www.aecassociacio.org/es/ "target =" _blank "> AEC </a>, the annual formation of the living school <a href =" https://www.elroure.org/ "target =" _blank "> El Roure </a> and currently undergoes 5-year therapeutic training in Psycho-Corporal Integration, at the <a href="http://psico-corporal.com/"target="_blank"> ETIP < / a>.</p>
                  
                <p align = justify> I have always been bubbled with ideas of all kinds of changes and solutions for the world, products and companies, forms of organization and decision, and in recent years some projects have been taking shape. In 2018 I co-started <a href="https://kunkoro.kiwi/#"target="_blank"> Kun Koro </a>, to advise respectful dining rooms from the midday experience of the school <a href = "http://escolacongresindians.com/" target = "_blank"> Congrés-Indians </a>. In 2019 I created <a href="https://haruki.es/"target="_blank"> Haruki </a>, a catalog of recommended products for a good life according to my criteria. Since 2017 I study about the cryptocurrency industry and basic economy, and in 2020 I published <a href="https://view.genial.ly/5e8a3aac260c290e39b5dc87/guide-liberty-financial"target="_blank"> this guide < / a> on how to improve your financial freedom from a vision of creating together a better world for all. Also in 2020 I founded<a href="https://huri.me"target="_blank"> Hurime</a> network, a project that brings together families and accompaniment professionals with a respectful approach towards the needs of each.</p></p>
                  
                <p align = justify> I am always working on expanding and improving my projects and developing new projects, which I will post for reference at <a href="https://noelcresencio.com/"target="_blank"> my website </ a>.</p>

								<p>Graduated in Education.</p>

								<p align=justify>Since the year 2000 I felt called to explore areas that would approach the relationships between people. I started my studies in Argentina where I made an intense and diverse journey between psychology, dramatic art and theology. These branches made me connect with human relationships and the multiple paths we approach to get closer or away from each other. In 2013, already located in Barcelona, I finished my undergraduate studies in children's education at the Autonomous University of Barcelona.</p><p align = justify> These years of studies aroused a huge interest in different pedagogies. Before finishing my degree, in 2011, I contacted the public school <a href="http://escolacongresindians.com/"target="_blank">Congrés-Indians</a>, since I was interested in learning and sharing experiences about the alive and active education. That's how I started the path as a volunteer and then joined the school's midday team, which I currently coordinate. The experience of these years in the school, both as a volunteer, as a midday companion and as an educator in the lective period, has moved me to form myself with Verónica Antón (<a href = "https://sendabcn.com/" target = "_ blank">Senda</a>) in the emotional accompaniment and in projects of alive and active pedagogy, also with <a href="http://www.verpensarsentir.es/"target="_blank">Jenny Silvente</a> in the game with minimons (small-worlds). I am currently doing studies at <a href="https://www.peretarres.org/"target="_blank">Pere Tarrés</a> to obtain the title of director of <i>lleure</i>.</p>

								<h2 class="major">The Forgotten Age</h2>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Club/Edad1.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<p>Adolescence is a forgotten and somewhat cursed age; the idea that, socially and in general, we have on it is loaded with negativity: it is a difficult, conflicting stage, adolescents are dispersed, lazy, uncollaborative, incomprehensible, arrogant, narcissistic, rebellious, emotionally unstable, etc. Adults are often overwhelmed by adolescent energy, then the frustration appears, lack of communication and control, prohibition or punishment are established as coexistence strategies.</p>
								<p>Curiously enough, each adult has been a teenager and we can connect with our experience at that stage, to know through what we have lived, what we needed at the time, what was important for us and what limited us or hindered our growth. All of that can be inspiring when it comes to understanding other teenagers, today's teenagers.</p> 
								<p>As kids, to obtain emotional security, we need the unconscious image that adults know what should be done and do so, therefore, they are not wrong. In addition, we need their recognition and approval, their love, for what their are our models are which we follow and imitate. According to my personal experience and my observation as an education professional, in adolescence that unconscious image of adults sinks, more or less suddenly. The childlike fantasy of the “perfect adult world” that we had in childhood, disappears.</p>
								<p>Upon reaching preadolescence, a huge evolutionary change begins, the whole organism is put into action to generate the transition from childhood to adulthood, a fundamental transition in the life of anyone. That convulsive revolution is adolescence. We begin to have some emotional autonomy and greater capacity to be aware of our reality and that of others, because the emotional security that comes from the adult is no longer so necessary.</p> 
								<p>The adult and his world begin to appear in sight more broadly, with its negative aspect included; their mistakes, inconsistencies and weaknesses. There is a greater capacity to see globality and to objectify and at the same time the vision is very conditioned by the connection and the emotional bond established with adults. The look towards adults is very selective, often radical, which usually shows adults who are rejected and adults who are worshiped.</p> 
								<p>The world appears as a place to discover, beyond the family environment and its values. Before that unlimited awakening, the teenager closes his eyes and evades or questions and rebels, wants to change the world. It is a vulnerable and delicate stage, in which there is a deep desire for freedom, to explore the unknown, often touching the limits established by the family or society. Everything is possible with the overflowing adolescent energy and at the same time there is nothing more than the present moment and its intensity, be that of enjoyment or that of anguish.</p>  
								<p>Awareness of oneself is much greater and a complex process of conscious construction of identity begins; that is, I begin to wonder who I am and who I want to be. To be aware of themselves, teenagers need to distinguish themselves from the mother and father, distance themselves from them, reaffirm their difference. They need to create an image of themselves, look for models outside the family, belong to the peer group intensely to feel complicity in standing before such a task ahead.</p>
								<p>I believe that it is a pending responsibility to generate open spaces for adolescents that can contribute to a deeply fruitful experience, both for the adolescents themselves and for their families; spaces where the listening they need and demand can be given, being protagonists of their own learning and maturation processes, following their own rhythm and manner, without being judged by their search attempts.</p> 
								<p>I imagine these spaces as meeting places where teenagers are able to invest their energy, express it and channel it in a positive way, either towards themselves or towards others. That requires a conscious and respectful adult accompaniment, tuned between professionals and family. An accompaniment like this implies for adults an invitation to leave the dualistic beliefs that contrast work and leisure, learning and fun, which associate action with learning and passivity with the loss of time, etc. and allow the flow of life to be expressed, with its fluidity and movement, with its diversity of aspects. It also means attending to the tensions, blockages and difficulties that are manifested and that limit this vital flow, both individually and in groups.</p>
								<p>Adolescence is essential as a crossroads to adult life. That is why I think it is essential to create this type of support spaces for adolescents and their families, in which the meaning and needs of this crucial stage are deeply understood, in general, so misunderstood and neglected.</p>

								<p>We think that the proposal you make is attractive and necessary. It is important to open a space for these ages, with heart, with listening and attention to their needs.</p>
								<p>A space beyond the school, and that can meet the dimensions and needs of their development, of their formation that has other characteristics to which the school can no longer respond, because it escapes its purpose.</p> 
								<p>A space like the one you propose is necessary, because at an age when girls and boys begin to detach themselves from their family models and seek other relationships, sometimes they find themselves in a vacuum between more normalized school spaces, and the relationships that are exploring outside the family and the guardianship of adults.</p>
								<p>In addition to this is the difficulty to dispose of a place, a physical environment, other than the family home, but not just the street.</p> 
								<p>That is why we think it is important to have a physical and relational space, attended by respectful adults, who are neither the school nor the family, and that can open up new possibilities for experience. An environment in which adults are present, but not on them at all times. Adults who are neither mothers nor fathers, neither teachers.</p> 
								<p>The art here in knowing how to create and take care of that new place that is neither school nor family, but where there is the possibility of a meeting, of adults of reference and of new possibilities of relationship and activity. And there, it is essential to have two people like you, with experience, with training and sensitivity to capture the environments and their needs and to know how to be adults of reference who are neither teachers nor family.</p>  
								<p>We believe that the meaning of your space in question is not to support the adaptive capacity of young people to the world they are imposing on us, but that they can find the deep meaning of what moves them internally as meaning and yearning for life; to be committed to life and the world. It is not the sense of adapting, but of connecting with their deep inner sense that guides them. We understand that the important thing is a space where they can have time, calmness with respect to external pressures, relationships and reflections to discover themselves, to recognize and clarify their desires, and to explore who they are, who they want to be and what paths they want to try to find their sense of self and their direction in life.</p>
